# Extract-text-from-pdf
I was sure that Python could do it via the pdfminer.six library.
pip install pdfminer.six
make sure this library installed into your computer

I just put the pdf in the same directory as the script and type:
python pdf_to_text.py python.pdf

you can change python.pdf with your file make sure upload your pdf file in same path you get out.tex file in same directory after Runing this script 

Reading down the code you can see itâ€™s only a few commands and lets the library do the work. I added the encoding part for the output file as sometimes strange characters are in pdfs.

Enjoy!
